## Rules and Guidelines



### Recording the Solve

- If you expect to be in the Top 5, you must record all your solves. If you are just participating for fun, it is not necessary to record, although we recommend that you do so. 
- **Record all the 5 scrambles + solves in a single video.** This is to reduce the possibilities of cheating. 
- All the solves must be recorded and uploaded in the Google Form provided by **9:30 PM IST**. 



### Scrambles

- Scrambles will be uploaded by 9 PM. There will be 5 scrambles.
- Scramble the cube with **Green** center on front and **White** center on top. 



### Using a Timer

- If you have a Stackmat timer, you may use it.
- You may use any of these helpful timers for the solve. You can enable inspection time in the settings. Test them a few times to be comfortable with them before the actual event. Use Space-bar to start and stop them. They are both mobile-friendly.
  - https://speedcube.app/ [You need to hold the Space-bar till the time turns green to start]
  - https://bennyboy.tech/minimalistimer/
- You are free to use any other timer website or application. 



### Inspection and Solving

- If you have a cube cover (a box or maybe a large enough bowl), it is recommended that you use it, although it is not strictly necessary.
  - Once you have scrambled the cube, cover the cube with a box or a bowl, if you can.
  - Start the inspection timer, lift the cover and put it aside. 
- You have **15 seconds** to inspect the cube. You must start the solve within that time. Put the cube down before starting the timer.
- Start the timer, pick the cube and start solving. When the solve is completed, leave the cube from your hands and then stop the timer.
- **Solved State and Penalties**
  - If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state or no face is out of place by more than 45 degrees, the puzzle is considered solved without penalty. Record the time simply.
  - If one move (either a single 45-90 degree rotation or a 180 degree rotation of an outer face) is required, the puzzle is be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds). Record the time and mark penalty as `+2`.
  - If more than one move is required, the puzzle is considered unsolved and recorded as `DNF` (Did Not Finish). Record the solve simply as `DNF`.



### Scoring

- The Team will verify the uploaded videos and present the scores to the WhatsApp group as soon as possible.
- If there are enough members participating, we would also keep an institute leader-board, with the following statistics:
  - Average of all solves from an institute
  - "Average of 5" solves from each participant in a given institute
  - Single Best Solve from a given institute 



> **Average of 5** ([Regulation 9f8](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#9f8)): Of the 5 attempts, the best and worst attempts are removed, and the arithmetic mean of the remaining 3 attempts is taken.



### Results

- The person with the best average will be declared the winner of the competition.
- If there is enough participation, the institute with the best *Average of 5* solves will be declared the winner of the competition.

A leader board will be published as well.
