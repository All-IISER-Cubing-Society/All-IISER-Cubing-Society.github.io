# AICS Cubing League

> “Once I completed the Cube and demonstrated it to my students, I realized it was nearly impossible to put down.”
> -- Erno Rubik

We at the All IISER Cubing Society (AICS) feel the same - it is not easy to put the cube down. To help cultivate cubing among our institutes, AICS is coming up with, well, something special. 

We present the AICS Cubing League, a showdown between cubers from the science institutes of India.

## Eligibility 

Only current students from the following institutes can participate:

- All IISERs
- IISc
- NISER
- CEBS

## Competition Structure

Do read the rules in the next section after the competition structure.

### Preliminary Round

If you have participated in our Weekly Events, this will be just like that.

Each institute will be assigned points based on their participation. **1 point for each participant from the institute.**

We will have a Google Form, with Scrambles in it. You'll get *5 Scrambles*. Solving and recording at least one scramble is mandatory and enough to submit your participation. However, for selecting the cubers representing the institute teams, we will consider Average of 5 (AO5) score, so you are encouraged to do all the solves.

**It is mandatory to submit a video of at least one solve.** Here is a [Video Compression Guide](/compression). We advise testing your recording setup prior to the competition.


The top 3 cubers from each institute will be forming the institute team.

The institutes will be ranked based on their participation, and placed into two groups. The Preliminary Round points will not carry forward onto further rounds. 

The selected cubers forming the team can choose to give themselves a name for the team.

NOTE: In case of less participation, we might decide to keep only a single group. The final decisions rest with the organisers.

### Group Stage

- Institute Teams will be assigned to one of the two groups based on participation.
- All teams start with 0 points. [Points from Prelims don't carry over here.]
- Each institute team will face off every other team in their group.
- Each match will have 3 sets of 5 solves. Each set is a head-to-head between two opposing cubers.
  - The team announces the order of their cubers for each set before the start of the match.
  - Each set is a head-to-head of the opposing cubers using the ordering given by the team, for the 5 solves.
    - Each win in a solve gives 1 point to the institute.
    - The cuber winning the set gets 3 extra points.
    - Winning all 5 solves ("Clean Sweep") in the set grants an additional 2 points.
  - If an institute wins all 3 sets in a match, they get an additional 3 points.

The top 2 teams in each group advance to the Play-offs.

### Play-offs

This will follow the IPL Format.

The first placed teams in both groups will play Qualifier-1, and the winning team advances to the Finals. The losing team goes to the Qualifier-2.

The second placed teams in both groups will play Eliminator. The losing team finishes 4th. The winning team advances to Qualifier-2.

The winner of Qualifier-2 advances to the Finals. The losing team finishes 3rd.

Each of the Qualifier-1, Qualifier-2 and Eliminator Rounds has the match format as in the Group Stage, but with 7 solves in each set (instead of 5).

### Finals

The winning teams of Qualifier-1 and Qualifier-2 face off in the Finals. The Finals match has the same format as the Play-offs.

## Rules and Guidelines

### Scrambles

- Scrambles will be uploaded at the start of the event. There will be 5 scrambles.
- Scramble the cube with **Green** center on front and **White** center on top. 

### Using a Timer

This is for the Preliminary Round. For the Final Rounds, we will have a consistent configuration, which will be communicated later on.

- If you have a Stackmat timer, you may use it.
- You may use any of these helpful timers for the solve. You can enable inspection time in the settings. Test them a few times to be comfortable with them before the actual event. Use Space-bar to start and stop them. They are both mobile-friendly.
  - https://speedcube.app/ [You need to hold the Space-bar till the time turns green to start]
  - https://bennyboy.tech/minimalistimer/
- You are free to use any other timer website or application. 


### Inspection and Solving

- If you have a cube cover (a box or maybe a large enough bowl), it is recommended that you use it, although it is not strictly necessary.
  - Once you have scrambled the cube, cover the cube with a box or a bowl, if you can.
  - Start the inspection timer, lift the cover and put it aside. 
- You have **15 seconds** to inspect the cube. You must start the solve within that time. Put the cube down before starting the timer.
- Start the timer, pick the cube and start solving. When the solve is completed, leave the cube from your hands and then stop the timer.
- **Solved State and Penalties**
  - If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state or no face is out of place by more than 45 degrees, the puzzle is considered solved without penalty. Record the time simply.
  - If one move (either a single 45-90 degree rotation or a 180 degree rotation of an outer face) is required, the puzzle is be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds). Record the time and mark penalty as `+2`.
  - If more than one move is required, the puzzle is considered unsolved and recorded as `DNF` (Did Not Finish). Record the solve simply as `DNF`.
- Report the time in ss.mm (seconds.millseconds) format. For example, a time of 1 minute 23.54 seconds has to be reported as `83.54`.
