# AICS Cubing League

> “Once I completed the Cube and demonstrated it to my students, I realized it was nearly impossible to put down.”
> -- Erno Rubik

We at the All IISER Cubing Society (AICS) feel the same - it is not easy to put the cube down. To help cultivate cubing among our institutes, AICS is coming up with, well, something special. 

We present the AICS Cubing League, a showdown between cubers from the science institutes of India.

## Competition Structure

Do read the rules in the next section after the competition structure.

### Preliminary Round

If you have participated in our Weekly Events, this will be just like that.

We will have a Google Form, with Scrambles in it. You'll get 5 solves, and you have to submit your times using the form.

**Make sure to also record yourself** doing all the solves, and submit a single video on the form. Here is a [Video Compression Guide](/compression). We advise testing your recording setup prior to the competition.
