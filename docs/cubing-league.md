# AICS Cubing League

> “Once I completed the Cube and demonstrated it to my students, I realized it was nearly impossible to put down.”
> -- Erno Rubik

We at the All IISER Cubing Society (AICS) feel the same - it is not easy to put the cube down. To help cultivate cubing among our institutes, AICS is coming up with, well, something special. 

We present the AICS Cubing League, a showdown between cubers from the science institutes of India.

## Eligibility 

Only current students from the following institutes can participate:

- All IISERs
- IISc
- NISER
- CEBS

## Competition Structure

Do read the rules in the next section after the competition structure.

### Preliminary Round

If you have participated in our Weekly Events, this will be just like that.

We will have a Google Form, with Scrambles in it. You'll get 5 solves, and you have to submit your times using the form.

**Make sure to also record yourself** doing all the solves, and submit a single video on the form. Here is a [Video Compression Guide](/compression). We advise testing your recording setup prior to the competition.

## Rules and Guidelines

### Scrambles

- Scrambles will be uploaded at the start of the event. There will be 5 scrambles.
- Scramble the cube with **Green** center on front and **White** center on top. 

### Using a Timer

This is for the Preliminary Round. For the Final Rounds, we will have a consistent configuration, which will be communicated later on.

- If you have a Stackmat timer, you may use it.
- You may use any of these helpful timers for the solve. You can enable inspection time in the settings. Test them a few times to be comfortable with them before the actual event. Use Space-bar to start and stop them. They are both mobile-friendly.
  - https://speedcube.app/ [You need to hold the Space-bar till the time turns green to start]
  - https://bennyboy.tech/minimalistimer/
- You are free to use any other timer website or application. 


### Inspection and Solving

- If you have a cube cover (a box or maybe a large enough bowl), it is recommended that you use it, although it is not strictly necessary.
  - Once you have scrambled the cube, cover the cube with a box or a bowl, if you can.
  - Start the inspection timer, lift the cover and put it aside. 
- You have **15 seconds** to inspect the cube. You must start the solve within that time. Put the cube down before starting the timer.
- Start the timer, pick the cube and start solving. When the solve is completed, leave the cube from your hands and then stop the timer.
- **Solved State and Penalties**
  - If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state or no face is out of place by more than 45 degrees, the puzzle is considered solved without penalty. Record the time simply.
  - If one move (either a single 45-90 degree rotation or a 180 degree rotation of an outer face) is required, the puzzle is be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds). Record the time and mark penalty as `+2`.
  - If more than one move is required, the puzzle is considered unsolved and recorded as `DNF` (Did Not Finish). Record the solve simply as `DNF`.
- Report the time in ss.mm (seconds.millseconds) format. For example, a time of 1 minute 23.54 seconds has to be reported as `83.54`.
