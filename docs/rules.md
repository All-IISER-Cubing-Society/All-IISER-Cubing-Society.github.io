# Rules and Guidelines


## Recording the Solve

- It is not necessary to record the solves, but we certainly recommend you to do so, if you can.
- You can also refer to the [Video Compression Guide](/compression) guide for compressing the videos.
- Upload the videos on the Google Form.



## Scrambles

- Scrambles will be uploaded at the start of the event. There will be 5 scrambles.
- Scramble the cube with **Green** center on front and **White** center on top. 



## Using a Timer

- If you have a Stackmat timer, you may use it.
- You may use any of these helpful timers for the solve. You can enable inspection time in the settings. Test them a few times to be comfortable with them before the actual event. Use Space-bar to start and stop them. They are both mobile-friendly.

- You are free to use any other timer website or application. 



## Inspection and Solving

- If you have a cube cover (a box or maybe a large enough bowl), it is recommended that you use it, although it is not strictly necessary.
  - Once you have scrambled the cube, cover the cube with a box or a bowl, if you can.
  - Start the inspection timer, lift the cover and put it aside. 
- You have **15 seconds** to inspect the cube. You must start the solve within that time. Put the cube down before starting the timer.
- Start the timer, pick the cube and start solving. When the solve is completed, leave the cube from your hands and then stop the timer.
- **Solved State and Penalties**
  - If no further moves are required to bring the puzzle to its solved state or no face is out of place by more than 45 degrees, the puzzle is considered solved without penalty. Record the time simply.
  - If one move (either a single 45-90 degree rotation or a 180 degree rotation of an outer face) is required, the puzzle is be considered solved with a time penalty (+2 seconds). Record the time and mark penalty as `+2`.
  - If more than one move is required, the puzzle is considered unsolved and recorded as `DNF` (Did Not Finish). Record the solve simply as `DNF`.



## Scoring and Results

- The Team will verify the uploaded videos and present the scores as soon as possible.

- If there are enough members participating, we would also keep an institute leader-board with some appropriate statistics.
